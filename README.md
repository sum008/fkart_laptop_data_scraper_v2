This scraper will scrape laptop information from flipkkart, will do the cleaning and store the result into seatable which is a excel like cloud based storage.

For this project I have used the free-tier seatable with provides 2GB of data storage and 10000 row storage which whas enough for this project.

To use this project, you need to create account on seatable and generate you access token. Use this for reference : https://api.seatable.io/reference/introduction

After generating your token, place that token in token.config.dist and update the name of this file to token.config

\*\*This project is in development phase\*\*
